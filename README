CGI::Application::Generator - Dynamically build CGI::Application modules
==========================================================================

CGI::Application::Generator provides a means by which a CGI::Application
module can be created from code, as opposed to being written by hand.

CHANGES SINCE VERSION 0.01:
- First release version of CGI::Application::Generator, a
  module intended to allow the creation of CGI::Application
  modules dynamically.
- Implemented an Object-Oriented interface to specify the
  functionality of your intended CGI::Application, used to 
  build the structure automatically using a (configurable)
  template file. 


HOW DO I INSTALL IT?

To install this module, cd to the directory that contains this README
file and type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install


CGI::Application::Generator is intended to create a shell of an
application module based on the specification you provide. It will not
output a completely functional application without additional coding. It
will, however, handle the creation of all the structural parts of your
application common to all CGI::Application-based modules.

The goal of CGI::Application::Generator is two-fold:

1. To ease the creation of new CGI::Application modules.
2. To allow standardization of CGI::Application coding styles to be
   more uniformly applied.

It is also the hope of this module that Computer Assisted Software
Engineering (CASE) tools will eventually emerge which will allow the
development process for web-based applications to be greatly improved.
These CASE tools could more easily convert visual notation (such as UML
state-transition diagrams) into method calls to this module, thereby
creating actual code.

CGI::Application::Generator is not a system for HTML templates. If
you're looking for a Perl module which will allow you to separate Perl
from HTML then I recommend you download and install HTML::Template.
